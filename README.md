# React-Native-Nubank ⚛️
A React Native clone of the Nubank mobile app bootstrapped with Expo.

This mobile app was created for me to learn new techniques inside React/React-Native world such as Animations and styling.

## Steps to run this project:
1. Clone the repo;
2. Navigate to the project folder;
3. `npm install` or `yarn install`;
4. and then `npm start` or `yarn start`;

## Styling:
To create the app's components styles I've used *styled-components* dependency. I've decided to use it because I think it make the project more organized and clean instead of stylesheet.

## Final thoughts:
This project has the goal to help me learning other concepts of React Native and I think that if it helps you too, it will be amazing.

### **WARNING:** be sure that you have the Expo app installed on your smartphone.
### PS: I've made it only debugging on a Xiaomi Mi A2 (5.99" inch display), so it might break when running on other devices.
